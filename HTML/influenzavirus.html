                    <h3 class="intro-1">Introduction to Influenza Virus</h3>
                    <p>
                        The influenza virus is a highly contagious virus that primarily affects the respiratory system, causing influenza (commonly called the "flu"). Influenza infections can range from mild to severe and, in some cases, can lead to life-threatening complications such as pneumonia, especially in high-risk populations like young children, the elderly, and individuals with chronic health conditions.
                        
                        Each year, influenza causes seasonal outbreaks that lead to millions of cases and hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations worldwide. The virus evolves quickly, making it a persistent global health challenge. This is due to its ability to undergo genetic changes that allow it to evade the immune system, necessitating the development of a new vaccine each flu season.</p>  
                        <h3 class="h3-Types">Types of Influenza Virus</h3>
                        <p>There are three main types of influenza viruses that infect humans: A, B, and C.</p>
                        
                        <ul><li>Influenza A:</li></ul>
                        
                       <p> Hosts: Influenza A can infect humans, birds, pigs, and other animals, and is the most common cause of flu epidemics and pandemics. It is responsible for the majority of seasonal flu outbreaks.
                        Subtypes: It is classified into subtypes based on two surface proteins: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). Examples include H1N1, H3N2, and others. Each combination of H and N proteins results in a different strain.
                        Pandemic Potential: Influenza A viruses are capable of causing pandemics, such as the 1918 Spanish flu and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.</p>
                        <ul><li>Influenza B:</li></ul>
                        
                        <p>Hosts: Influenza B mainly infects humans and can lead to significant flu seasons, though generally with less severe illness than Influenza A.
                        Lineages: It is divided into two main lineages: B/Yamagata and B/Victoria.
                        Epidemics: Influenza B can cause seasonal epidemics but does not have the same pandemic potential as Influenza A.</p>
                        <ul><li>Influenza C:</li></ul>
                        
                        <p>Hosts: This type primarily infects humans and swine, typically causing mild illness. Influenza C does not lead to large-scale epidemics or pandemics and is less well-studied than types A and B.</p>

                        The influenza virus is a category of viruses that have evolved over centuries, and its exact origin is difficult to pinpoint. Here's a detailed overview:

                    <h3 class="h3-Year-2">Year Originated</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                    <p>First recorded descriptions of influenza-like illnesses date back to ancient civilizations, including Hippocrates (around 400 BCE).
                    The first definitive influenza pandemic was recorded in 1580.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Influenza viruses are thought to have originated in wild aquatic birds, which serve as the natural reservoir for the viruses. From these reservoirs, the virus has evolved and adapted to infect various species, including humans, pigs, and other mammals.

                        Influenza spreads through several mediums:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Influenza A: Causes pandemics; infects humans, birds, and other animals.</li>

                            <li>Influenza C: Mild infections in humans and animals.</li>
                            <li>Influenza D: Primarily affects cattle.</li>

               <p>Influenza is a highly contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. It spreads primarily through respiratory droplets and can infect people quickly in various settings. Here are the detailed mechanisms of how influenza spreads:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Coughing and Sneezing: When an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, respiratory droplets containing the virus are expelled into the air.</li>
                        <li>Close Contact: People nearby (within 1-2 meters or 3-6 feet) can inhale these droplets, leading to infection.</li>

                        <li>Cold Weather: Influenza spreads more in cooler, drier climates (common in winter), as the virus survives longer in dry air, and people tend to gather indoors.</li>
                        <li>Crowded Spaces: Schools, offices, and public transport facilitate faster spread due to close contact between individuals.</li>

                <p>
                    Precautions are essential to prevent the spread of the influenza virus. Here are some key measures:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Annual Flu Shots: The most effective way to prevent influenza infection is to get the seasonal flu vaccine. This helps protect you from the virus strains circulating that year.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3 class="h3-Good">Good Hygiene Practices</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Cover Mouth and Nose: When coughing or sneezing, use a tissue or the elbow of your sleeve to cover your mouth and nose to prevent spreading droplets.</li>
                        <li>Dispose of Tissues Properly: Immediately dispose of tissues in a closed bin and wash your hands after using them.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3 class="h3-Maintain">Maintain Physical Distancing</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li>High-Touch Areas: Regularly disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as doorknobs, light switches, smartphones, and remote controls.</li>
                        <li>Use Disinfectant: Use disinfectants that are effective against the flu virus.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                        <li>Adequate Sleep: Ensure sufficient rest (7-9 hours) to help your body fight infections.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3 class="h3-Avoid ">Avoid Crowded Places</h3>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>During flu season, try to avoid large gatherings or places with high foot traffic, especially if you or others are unwell.</li>
                    </ul>

                  <p>There are four types of influenza viruses: A, B, C, and D. Influenza A and B are the most common causes of seasonal flu in humans. Influenza C causes mild illness, while Influenza D primarily affects cattle.</p>

                  <p>
                    The flu spreads through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. It can also spread by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes.

                  <p>
                    Flu symptoms usually come on suddenly and are more severe than cold symptoms. The flu often involves a high fever and significant fatigue, while colds are typically milder.
