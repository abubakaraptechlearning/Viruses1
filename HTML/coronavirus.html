            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6">
                    <h3 class="h3-intro"><u><b>Introduction</b></u></h3>
                    <p>The coronavirus (COVID-19) is a viral disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which first emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. It quickly spread globally, leading to a pandemic declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020.

                        Virus Family and Characteristics: SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Coronaviridae family, which includes other viruses responsible for respiratory illnesses, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus (MERS-CoV). The virus is named "corona" because of the crown-like spikes on its surface.
                        
                        Transmission: COVID-19 primarily spreads through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, or breathes. It can also spread through contact with contaminated surfaces. The virus can be transmitted by people who are symptomatic or asymptomatic (carriers without symptoms), which makes it challenging to control.
                        
                        Symptoms: Symptoms of COVID-19 vary widely and can range from mild to severe. Common symptoms include:
                        
                        Fever or chills
                        Cough
                        Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
                        Fatigue
                        Muscle or body aches
                        Loss of taste or smell
                        Sore throat
                        Congestion or runny nose
                        In some cases, the virus can cause severe respiratory illness, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multi-organ failure. Vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions, are at higher risk of severe illness and death.
                        
                        Prevention and Control: Preventive measures include wearing masks, social distancing, frequent handwashing, and avoiding crowded places. Vaccination has played a crucial role in reducing the severity of the disease and preventing widespread infection. Several COVID-19 vaccines, developed by companies like Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and AstraZeneca, have been authorized for emergency use around the world.
                        
                        Global Impact: The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching social, economic, and psychological impacts. Lockdowns, travel restrictions, and social distancing measures have disrupted economies, education, and healthcare systems globally. Efforts to mitigate the pandemic have also sparked debates over public health measures, personal freedoms, and economic recovery.
                        
                        Ongoing Challenges: As of the latest updates, the fight against COVID-19 continues, with variants of the virus (such as Delta, Omicron, and others) emerging, sometimes complicating the path to control. Continued vaccination efforts, along with public health strategies, remain critical in managing the pandemic.
                        
                        The scientific community remains vigilant in monitoring the virus, its mutations, and its impacts, while governments and organizations around the world continue to collaborate on strategies to limit its spread and mitigate its effects.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6">
                <h2 class="h2-location"><u><b>Location Of Origin</b></u></h2>
                
                <p>The origin of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, is believed to trace back to Wuhan, a city in central China, in late 2019. Early reports of unusual pneumonia cases were recorded in December 2019, and many of the initial patients had links to a seafood market in Wuhan, the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold live wild animals. This market is considered a likely starting point for the viruss spread, although the exact origins are still debated.

                Scientists believe that the virus likely originated in bats, which are known hosts for coronaviruses, and could have passed to humans either directly or via an intermediate animal host, possibly pangolins. However, there is still uncertainty about the exact pathway.

                The virus was first identified in a series of pneumonia cases, with a high number of early cases having direct or indirect contact with the market. By January 2020, human-to-human transmission was confirmed, leading to widespread concern.

                As the virus spread rapidly beyond China, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020, and later a global pandemic on March 11, 2020.

                While the viruss origin in wildlife is strongly suspected, there has been considerable debate, including theories about potential leaks from laboratories. However, the zoonotic (animal-to-human) origin remains the most widely accepted explanation.</p>

                <h2 class="h2-spread"><u><b>Spread Of Virus</b></u></h2>
                <h3 class="h3-Origin">Origin of Spread</h3><p>
                    The coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, likely originated in animals, with bats being the suspected natural reservoir. It is believed to have jumped to humans via an intermediary species, possibly in a wet market in Wuhan, China, in late 2019.<br></p>
                    
                    <h3 class="h3-Modes">Modes of Transmission</h3><p>
                    he virus primarily spreads through the following methods:
                    Respiratory Droplets: Released when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, or breathes. These droplets can infect others if inhaled or if they land on mucous membranes (eyes, nose, or mouth).
                    Aerosolized Particles: Tiny virus-laden particles can remain suspended in the air, especially in enclosed, poorly ventilated spaces, leading to airborne transmission.
                    Surface Contact (Fomites): The virus can survive on surfaces for varying durations. Touching contaminated surfaces and then touching the face may lead to infection, although this is less common.
                    Close Contact: Physical proximity, such as hugging or shaking hands, facilitates virus transmission.<br></p>
                    
                    <h3 class="h3-Factors">Factors Influencing Spread</h3><p>
                    Human Behavior: Social gatherings, travel, and non-compliance with preventative measures (e.g., mask-wearing, handwashing).
                    Environment: Crowded and poorly ventilated spaces increase transmission risk. Outdoor settings are generally safer due to better air circulation.
                    Variants: Mutations can enhance transmissibility. For example, the Delta and Omicron variants have shown higher transmission rates compared to the original strain.<br></p>
                    
                    <h3 class="h3-Incubation">Incubation Period and Contagiousness</h3> <p>
                    The incubation period (time from exposure to symptoms) is typically 2-14 days, with an average of 5 days.
                    People are most contagious 1-2 days before symptom onset and during the first week of illness. Asymptomatic individuals can also spread the virus.<br></p>
                    
                    <h3 class="h3-Global">Global and Local Spread</h3><p>
                    Global Spread: The virus spreads rapidly due to modern travel, allowing infected individuals to carry it across countries and continents.
                    Local Spread: Community transmission occurs when infected individuals unknowingly spread the virus within their community.<br></p>
                    
                    <h3 class="h3-Prevention">Prevention Measures</h3><p>
                    Personal Actions: Mask-wearing, maintaining physical distance, regular hand hygiene, and avoiding crowded spaces.
                    Public Health Measures: Vaccination campaigns, testing, contact tracing, isolation of cases, and quarantine for exposed individuals.<br></p>

                <div class="panel">
                  <p>Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as SARS and MERS. COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2, first identified in December 2019.

                <div class="panel">
                  <p>COVID-19 spreads primarily through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, or breathes. It can also spread by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching the face, although this is less common.

                <button class="accordion"><h4 class="space1">What are the common symptoms of COVID-19? </h4></button>
                <div class="panel">
                  <p>Common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, fatigue, and loss of taste or smell. Other symptoms may involve shortness of breath, sore throat, muscle aches, headache, congestion, nausea, or diarrhea. Severe cases can cause difficulty breathing, chest pain, confusion, or bluish lips, requiring immediate medical attention. Symptoms usually appear 2-14 days after exposure, though some individuals may remain asymptomatic.

                <button class="accordion"><h4 class="space1">Are Coronavirus infections serious?</h4></button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Coronavirus infections can range from mild to severe. While many people experience mild symptoms like fever, cough, and fatigue, others may develop serious complications such as pneumonia, difficulty breathing, or organ failure. Older adults and individuals with underlying health conditions (e.g., heart disease, diabetes, or weakened immune systems) are at higher risk of severe illness. In rare cases, COVID-19 can be life-threatening, emphasizing the importance of preventive measures and timely medical care.
